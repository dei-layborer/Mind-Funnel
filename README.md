 Tools to help with memorization

Currently just a "memory" type thing (bunch of cards in a grid, click to flip, find "matches", i.e. whatever two cards link together).

### To Do
- [ ] Finalize data format
- [ ] Make it easier to add new card/data sets
- [ ] Make matched cards not re-flippable
- [ ] Fix/improve visual changes showing a match
- [ ] Fix visuals overall, really.
